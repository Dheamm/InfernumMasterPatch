# Infernum Master Patch

Infernum Master Patch is a compatibility patch that allows you to run **Infernum Mode** on **Master Mode** and **For the Worthy** seeds.

## Overview

By default, Infernum is restricted to Expert Mode. This mod bypasses that limit by providing a dedicated toggle that allows both modes to run simultaneously.

## How to use

Just as standard Infernum follows the hierarchy of **Expert + Revengeance + Infernum**, this patch establishes a new progression: **Master + Death + Infernum**.

1. Enter your world.
2. Open the **Calamity Difficulty UI**.
3. Click the **"Infernum Master"** icon located next to Death Mode.
4. Have fun.

## Note

This combination is **not officially balanced** by the Infernum team and does not change the stats of bosses altered by the mod (unless own scaling allows it).

Be prepared for extreme and unbalanced difficulty.
