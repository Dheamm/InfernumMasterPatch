Infernum Master Patch is a compatibility patch that allows you to run Infernum Mode on Master Mode and "For the Worthy" seeds.

By default, Infernum does not allow Master Mode. This mod bypasses that restriction through a non-invasive state override.

How to use:
Just as standard Infernum follows the hierarchy of Expert + Revengeance + Infernum, this patch establishes a new progression Master + Death + Infernum:

1. Set the world difficulty to Master Mode.
2. Activate Death Mode (Calamity).
3. The mod will automatically trigger Infernum Mode.

Note: This combination is not officially balanced by the Infernum team. Be prepared for extreme and unbalanced difficulty.
