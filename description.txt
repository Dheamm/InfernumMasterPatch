Infernum Master Patch is a compatibility patch that allows you to run Infernum Mode on Master Mode and "For the Worthy" seeds.

By default, Infernum is restricted to Expert Mode. This mod bypasses that limit by providing a dedicated toggle that allows both modes to run simultaneously.

How to use:
Just as standard Infernum follows the hierarchy of Expert + Revengeance + Infernum, this patch establishes a new progression: Master + Death + Infernum.

1. Enter your world.
2. Open the Calamity Difficulty UI.
3. Click the "Infernum Master" icon located next to Death Mode.
4. Have fun.

Note: This combination is not officially balanced by the Infernum team and does not change the stats of bosses altered by the mod (unless own scaling allows it). 

Be prepared for extreme and unbalanced difficulty.
